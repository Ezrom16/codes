      Community hygiene is the first line of defense against disease outbreaks.
      In our recent outreach program, we visited several villages to demonstrate
      how to wash hands, store food properly, and dispose of waste safely.

      Over 300 people attended these sessions. We distributed illustrated guides and soap,
      and set up simple handwashing stations. It was amazing to see how engaged the
      local leaders were.

      Maintaining hygiene is not just about health — it builds dignity, confidence,
      and respect in the community. Together, we can prevent illness before it spreads.
